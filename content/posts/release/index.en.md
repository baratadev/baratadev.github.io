TEST is a Brazilian duo formed in 2010 by **João Kombi** (guitar and vocals) and **Barata** (drums), two veterans of São Paulo’s underground scene. Known for their intense live performances, notable collaborations with artists like Iggor Cavalera and Deafkids, and a fearless musical approach, the band has established itself as one of the most inventive names in the Brazilian alternative scene.

From the deathgrind band initially known for playing outside of major heavy metal concerts, fueled by a old school VW van-powered generator, Test has gone a long way since 2011, when the band started playing on the streets.

Since then, the band has shared stages - inside the venue this time, be it as opening band or headlining - with artists such as King Diamond, Napalm Death, Carcass, Cannibal Corpse, Exodus e Brujeria, Mayhem, Mortician, Dillinger Escape Plan, to name a few. Speaking of name-dropping, some famous Test fans include Shane Embury, Napalm Death's bass player, and the brothers Max and Iggor Cavalera - Iggor, by the way, has chosen Test's drummer on the top 10 drummers of all time.

Aside from performing with well-know heavy metal artists, Test also took part in two of the major extreme music festivals worldwide: "Obscene Extreme", in the Czech Republic and Mexico, and "Maryland Deathfest", in the US.

## THE ROAD SO FAR

With a steady recording and playing live pace, Test turns fifteen years old with 18 albums (full-lenghts, EPs and split-album with bands from different parts of the world, like Nepal [Chepang], U.S.A. [Cloud Rat, Ixias] and China [Struggle Session]), two feature films, more than ten thousand records sold and more than one thousand shows in all states of Brazil, as well as twenty one foreign tours (Asia, Europe, North America and South America).

Perpetually on the road, the tours of their full albums, always exceed the mark of 250 shows, always passing through many new places. Now they are doing another intense battery of shows to promote their new album “Disco Normal”, released in may 2023.
